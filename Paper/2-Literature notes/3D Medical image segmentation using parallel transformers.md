- DeLighT transformation uses  group linear transformations (GLTs) with more groups to learn wider representations with fewer parameters.

# Grouped linear transformation

the heart of the PRU is the pyramidal transforma-  
tion (PT), which uses subsampling to effect multi-  
ple views of the input vector. The subsampled rep-  
resentations are combined in a pyramidal fusion  
structure, resulting in richer interactions between  
the individual dimensions of the input vector than  
is possible with a linear transformation.

The differences between  
the input and context vector motivate their sepa-  
rate treatment in the PRU architecture.
