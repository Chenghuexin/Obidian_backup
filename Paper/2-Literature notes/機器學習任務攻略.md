# 當訓練資料的loss表現不好時該如何改善

## 1. training data set is bigger

### issue 1 : model bias

When model is too simple, model's function set is too small to make loss decrease

**Solution** : redesign your model to make it more flexible

### issue 2 : optimization

optimization can't find the function of lower loss 

**Solution** : Start from shallower networks or model which are easier to optimize, if deeper networks do not obtain smaller loss on training data, then there is optimization issue(not overfitting)
