# 當訓練資料的loss表現不好時該如何改善

## 1. if training data's loss is large

### issue 1 : model bias

When model is too simple, model's function set is too small to make loss decrease

**Solution** : redesign your model to make it more flexible

### issue 2 : optimization

optimization can't find the function of lower loss 

**how to judge whether it is model bias or optimization** : Start from shallower networks or model which are easier to optimize, if deeper networks do not obtain smaller loss on training data, then there is optimization issue(not overfitting)

**solution : 待補充**

- [11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeHM2xpYQpw&t=714#t=11:53.71) optimization issue example, because 20-layer loss is lower than 56-layer, that means model's elasticity is sufficient

## 2. if training data's loss is small

### if testing data's loss is small
